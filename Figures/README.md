# Figures
- Each folder contains R code and the PDF figures used in the manuscript
- "Utility_Functions.R" contains R code that many of the figure-specific files use.
- Data used in constructing the figures must be downloaded from the manuscript-specific data repositories. These are listed in each figure's README.md
