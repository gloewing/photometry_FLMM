    "### Apple Silicon's ARM Architecture vs. Legacy x86 Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple Silicon, used in M1, M2, and M3 chips, is based on ARM architecture, which differs significantly from the legacy x86 architecture used in older Intel-based Macs. ARM architecture is known for its efficiency and performance per watt, making it ideal for mobile and low-power devices. In contrast, x86 architecture is designed for high-performance computing but is less power-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "R users cannot use compiled binaries for x86 chips on Macs with M-chips because of the architectural differences. Binaries compiled for x86 are not natively compatible with ARM architecture. While Rosetta 2 can translate x86 binaries to run on ARM, this can lead to performance degradation and compatibility issues. Therefore, it is recommended to use binaries specifically compiled for ARM architecture to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.\n",

    "### Xcode\n",
    "\n",
    "Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) that includes a suite of software development tools for macOS. It is essential for compiling and building software on macOS, including R and its packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasons for Installing Xcode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Command Line Tools**: Xcode provides command line tools (such as `gcc`, `make`, and `clang`) that are necessary for compiling R from source and for installing R packages that contain C, C++, or Fortran code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Package Installation**: Many R packages require compilation during installation. Without Xcode's command line tools, these packages cannot be compiled and installed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Development**: For users who develop R packages or need to compile custom code, Xcode provides the necessary tools and libraries to support development on macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Xcode command line tools, you can run the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### gfortran compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a \"univervsal\" compiler that works for both x86 and ARM architectures that is [recommended by R] (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/). Please ensure a gfortran compiler is installed prior to installing `fastFMM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XQuartz Install\n",
    "\n",
    "XQuartz is an open-source version of the X.Org X Window System that runs on macOS. It provides a graphical environment for Unix-based applications, including R, to display graphical output. To install XQuartz, you can download it from [XQuartz's official website](https://www.xquartz.org/) and follow the installation instructions."
