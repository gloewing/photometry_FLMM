    "### Apple Silicon's ARM Architecture vs. Legacy x86 Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple Silicon, used in M1, M2, and M3 chips, is based on ARM architecture, which differs significantly from the legacy x86 architecture used in older Intel-based Macs. ARM architecture is known for its efficiency and performance per watt, making it ideal for mobile and low-power devices. In contrast, x86 architecture is designed for high-performance computing but is less power-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "R users cannot use compiled binaries for x86 chips on Macs with M-chips because of the architectural differences. Binaries compiled for x86 are not natively compatible with ARM architecture. While Rosetta 2 can translate x86 binaries to run on ARM, this can lead to performance degradation and compatibility issues. Therefore, it is recommended to use binaries specifically compiled for ARM architecture to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.\n",

    "1. Click on the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen.\n",
    "2. Select \"About This Mac\" from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "3. In the window that appears, look for the \"Processor\" or \"Chip\" information:\n",
    "   - If it contains the word \"Intel,\" your Mac has an Intel x86 chip.\n",
